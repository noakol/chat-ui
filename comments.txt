Add your general design and decision comments here:

- i saved the user credentials in the session storage and not on the local - 
    it looks ok that user can end the chat session by just closing the tab
      
- i didn't have time to complete the testing part - i do familiar with 'chai' and 'enzim',
    but didn't have any more time to invest 

- it was the first time i encounter with sockt io
